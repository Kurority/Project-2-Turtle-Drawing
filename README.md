# Turtle Drawing Project: Pizza and Coke Can

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create two different drawings using Python's Turtle graphics library: a slice of pizza and a can of Coca-Cola. These drawings serve as a fun and educational way to learn about programming graphics in Python.

## Project Contents

The project contains the following main components:

1. **project 2.py**: This Python script draws a simple representation of a slice of pizza and Coke can using Turtle graphics.

2. **Drawing_Screenshot.png**: This directory contains image assets used in the project, such as textures for the pizza and label for the Coke can.

3. **README.md**: This file serves as an introduction and guide to the project.

## Prerequisites

- To run these scripts, you need to have Python installed on your computer.
- Make sure you have the Turtle graphics library, which is usually included with standard Python installations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Run the scripts using Python:

3. Observe the Turtle graphics window as it creates the drawings.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the drawings and add your own creative touches. You can modify colors, shapes, and labels as you see fit. Experiment and make the project your own!

## License

This project is open-source and available for everyone.

## Acknowledgments

- The project uses Python's Turtle graphics library.
- The Coca-Cola label font used is Arial.

Enjoy drawing and coding!
